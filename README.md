What is it?

Me and my partner Kody have decided to make a battle combat game called Steve Harvey Space Battle. It is inspired by games such as asteroids and galactica. Steve harvey is the main character and he tries to survive a finite amount of levels and the levels get harder! We added a new movement system where the main player, Steve, can glide!

Controls:
w - glide up
a - glide left
s - glide  down
d - glide right

left arrow key - rotate left
right arrow key - rotate left
up arrow key - rotate left
down arrow key - rotate left

Space - to shoot


How to run our game?

1. Create a java fx project in your eclipse ide.

2. Create a package name it whatever.

3. Copy the Game.java, Gameobject.java, HarveyFace.jpg, and Dumbbell-Nebula.jpg into your package.

4. Before you run, make sure eclipse run configuration is compatible with javafx.

5. Click run and have fun!
