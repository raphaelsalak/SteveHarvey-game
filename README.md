What is it?

Me and my partner Kody have decided to make a battle combat game called Steve Harvey Space Battle. It is inspired by games such as asteroids and galactica. Steve harvey is the main character and he tries to survive a finite amount of levels and the levels get harder! We added a new movement system where the main player, Steve, can glide!

Controls:
w - glide up
a - glide left
s - glide  down
d - glide right

left arrow key - rotate left
right arrow key - rotate left
up arrow key - rotate left
down arrow key - rotate left

Space - to shoot


How to run our game?

1. Create a java fx project in your eclipse ide.

2. Create a package name it "application" if you don't already have the default "application" package.

3. Copy the Game.java, Gameobject.java, HarveyFace.jpg, and Dumbbell-Nebula.jpg into your package. 

4. To copy the .jpg files, click on it, then click save image as. Drag the .jpg files to the application package. Make sure it retains the same name as their original respective filenames.

5. Before you run, make sure eclipse run configuration is compatible with javafx.

6. Click run and have fun!
