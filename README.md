What is it?

Me and my partner Kody have decided to make a questionaire battle combat game called Family Feud the game the series. It will have some elements of family feud with a twist! If they get the answer right, they move on to the next round, if they don't they will have to battle the current enemy at that room. They keep advancing until they reach steve harvey the main boss himself! Users who beat Steve Harvey will win the game!


How to run our game?
